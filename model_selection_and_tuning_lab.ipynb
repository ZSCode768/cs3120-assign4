Remember that a `hyperparameter` is a parameter of a model that is not fit/learned directly from the data. Rather, it is a value that determines _how the model will learn_ from the. Some examples are:\n",

However, if there were multiple hyperparameters and the second one had $n_{h2}$ possible values, and the third had $n_{h3}$, ..., and the $k^{th}$ had $n_{hk}$ possible values, then there would be an a huge number of possible combinations that we would need to consider (namely, $n_{h1}\\cdot n_{h2}\\cdot \\dots \\cdot n_{hk}$). Fortunately, most models do not have too many hyperparameters to consider, or perhaps not many values of each to consider, so in practice this is typically not too onerous.

Therefore, what we really need to do is to _estimate_ what our model's future accuracy will be. Which means that we have to get an idea of how much the accuracy (or RMSE) will vary from one _test_ dataset to another. As you know from basic Statistics, this sounds a lot like trying to undestand the variance of the model's performance metric for all possible future test datasets.\n",
